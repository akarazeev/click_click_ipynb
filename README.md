There are two versions of programs: for those who use Terminal application and those who use [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com).

Just drag app to "Applications" folder, with "Cmd+i" open one of the `.ipynb` files and select "Open with:" -> "Other..." -> path to `click_click_ipynb_iterm.app` or `click_click_ipynb_terminal.app` -> "Add" -> "Change All...".

Good luck!
